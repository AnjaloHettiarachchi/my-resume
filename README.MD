# My Resume

I have managed to design my resume using a simple design, but with a professional structure which is highly inspired from [these templates](https://novoresume.com/resume-templates) from [Novoresume.](https://novoresume.com/)

The live preview can be seen [here.](https://anjalohettiarachchi.github.io/my-resume/)

## Things I used

- Boostrap 4
- NPM
- Inter font family
- HTML5 / CSS
- Live Server with Visual Studio Code
- Git

## See it in action

- `git clone`
- `npm install`
- Render `index.html` in browser.
