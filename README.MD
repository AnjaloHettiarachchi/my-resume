# My Resume

Designed using pure HTML and CSS with a simple but professional structure which was highly inspired from [these templates](https://novoresume.com/resume-templates) from [Novoresume.](https://novoresume.com/)

## Things I used

- [Boostrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font family
- HTML5 / CSS
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## See it in action

- `git clone`
- `npm install`
- Render `index.html` with `Live Server` extension.
